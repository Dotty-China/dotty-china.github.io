Scala 3 implements [Version 6](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/improved-lazy-val-initialization.html#version-6---no-synchronization-on-this-and-concurrent-initialization-of-fields)
of the [SIP-20] improved lazy vals initialization proposal.

## Motivation

The newly proposed lazy val initialization mechanism aims to eliminate the acquisition of resources
during the execution of the lazy val initializer block, thus reducing the possibility of a deadlock.
The concrete deadlock scenarios that the new lazy val initialization scheme eliminates are
summarized in the [SIP-20] document.

## Implementation

Given a lazy field of the form:

```scala
class Foo {
  lazy val bar = <RHS>
}
```

The Scala 3 compiler will generate code equivalent to:

```scala
class Foo {
  import scala.runtime.LazyVals
  var value_0: Int = _
  var bitmap: Long = 0L
  val bitmap_offset: Long = LazyVals.getOffset(classOf[LazyCell], "bitmap")

  def bar(): Int = {
    while (true) {
      val flag = LazyVals.get(this, bitmap_offset)
      val state = LazyVals.STATE(flag, <field-id>)

      if (state == <state-3>) {
        return value_0
      } else if (state == <state-0>) {
        if (LazyVals.CAS(this, bitmap_offset, flag, <state-1>, <field-id>)) {
          try {
            val result = <RHS>
            value_0 = result
            LazyVals.setFlag(this, bitmap_offset, <state-3>, <field-id>)
            return result
          }
          catch {
            case ex =>
              LazyVals.setFlag(this, bitmap_offset, <state-0>, <field-id>)
              throw ex
          }
        }
      } else /* if (state == <state-1> || state == <state-2>) */ {
        LazyVals.wait4Notification(this, bitmap_offset, flag, <field-id>)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The state of the lazy val `<state-i>` is represented with 4 values: 0, 1, 2 and 3. The state 0
represents a non-initialized lazy val. The state 1 represents a lazy val that is currently being
initialized by some thread. The state 2 denotes that there are concurrent readers of the lazy val.
The state 3 represents a lazy val that has been initialized. `<field-id>` is the id of the lazy
val. This id grows with the number of volatile lazy vals defined in the class.

## Note on recursive lazy vals

Ideally recursive lazy vals should be flagged as an error. The current behavior for
recursive lazy vals is undefined (initialization may result in a deadlock).
