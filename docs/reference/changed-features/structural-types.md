## Motivation

Some usecases, such as modelling database access, are more awkward in
statically typed languages than in dynamically typed languages: With
dynamically typed languages, it's quite natural to model a row as a
record or object, and to select entries with simple dot notation (e.g.
`row.columnName`).

Achieving the same experience in statically typed
language requires defining a class for every possible row arising from
database manipulation (including rows arising from joins and
projections) and setting up a scheme to map between a row and the
class representing it.

This requires a large amount of boilerplate, which leads developers to
trade the advantages of static typing for simpler schemes where colum
names are represented as strings and passed to other operators (e.g.
`row.select("columnName")`). This approach forgoes the advantages of
static typing, and is still not as natural as the dynamically typed
version.

Structural types help in situations where we would like to support
simple dot notation in dynamic contexts without losing the advantages
of static typing. They allow developers to use dot notation and
configure how fields and methods should be resolved.

## Example

Here's an example of a structural type `Person`:

```scala
  class Record(elems: (String, Any)*) extends Selectable:
     private val fields = elems.toMap
     def selectDynamic(name: String): Any = fields(name)

  type Person = Record { val name: String; val age: Int }
 ```
 
The type `Person` adds a _refinement_ to its parent type `Record` that defines the two fields `name` and `age`. We say the refinement is _structural_ since  `name` and `age` are not defined in the parent type. But they exist nevertheless as members of class `Person`. For instance, the following
program would print  "Emma is 42 years old.":

```scala
  val person = Record("name" -> "Emma", "age" -> 42).asInstanceOf[Person]
  println(s"${person.name} is ${person.age} years old.")
```

The parent type `Record` in this example is a generic class that can represent arbitrary records in its `elems` argument. This argument is a
sequence of pairs of labels of type `String` and values of type `Any`.
When we create a `Person` as a `Record` we have to assert with a typecast
that the record defines the right fields of the right types. `Record`
itself is too weakly typed so the compiler cannot know this without
help from the user. In practice, the connection between a structural type
and its underlying generic representation would most likely be done by
a database layer, and therefore would not be a concern of the end user.

`Record` extends the marker trait `scala.Selectable` and defines
a method `selectDynamic`, which maps a field name to its value.
Selecting a structural type member is done by calling this method.
The `person.name` and `person.age` selections are translated by
the Scala compiler to:

```scala
  person.selectDynamic("name").asInstanceOf[String]
  person.selectDynamic("age").asInstanceOf[Int]
```

Besides `selectDynamic`, a `Selectable` class sometimes also defines a method `applyDynamic`. This can then be used to translate function calls of structural members. So, if `a` is an instance of `Selectable`, a structural call like `a.f(b, c)` would translate to

```scala
  a.applyDynamic("f")(b, c)
```

## Using Java Reflection

Structural types can also be accessed using [Java reflection](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javareflection.html). Example:

```scala
  type Closeable = { def close(): Unit }

  class FileInputStream:
    def close(): Unit

  class Channel:
    def close(): Unit
```

Here, we define a structural type `Closeable` that defines a `close` method. There are various classes that have `close` methods, we just list `FileInputStream` and `Channel` as two examples. It would be easiest if the two classes shared a common interface that factors out the `close` method. But such factorings are often not possible if different libraries are combined in one application. Yet, we can still have methods that work on
all classes with a `close` method by using the `Closeable` type. For instance,

```scala
  import scala.reflect.Selectable.reflectiveSelectable

  def autoClose(f: Closeable)(op: Closeable => Unit): Unit =
    try op(f) finally f.close()
```

The call `f.close()` has to use Java reflection to identify and call the `close` method in the receiver `f`. This needs to be enabled by an import
of `reflectiveSelectable` shown above. What happens "under the hood" is then the following:

 - The import makes available an implicit conversion that turns any type into a
   `Selectable`. `f` is wrapped in this conversion.

 - The compiler then transforms the `close` call on the wrapped `f`
   to an `applyDynamic` call. The end result is:

   ```scala
     reflectiveSelectable(f).applyDynamic("close")()
   ```
 - The implementation of `applyDynamic` in `reflectiveSelectable`'s result
uses Java reflection to find and call a method `close` with zero parameters in the value referenced by `f` at runtime.

Structural calls like this tend to be much slower than normal method calls. The mandatory import of `reflectiveSelectable` serves as a signpost that something inefficient is going on.

**Note:** In Scala 2, Java reflection is the only mechanism available for structural types and it is automatically enabled without needing the
`reflectiveSelectable` conversion. However, to warn against inefficient
dispatch, Scala 2 requires a language import `import scala.language.reflectiveCalls`.

Before resorting to structural calls with Java reflection one should consider alternatives. For instance, sometimes a more a modular _and_ efficient architecture can be obtained using type classes.

## Extensibility

New instances of `Selectable` can be defined to support means of
access other than Java reflection, which would enable usages such as
the database access example given at the beginning of this document.

## Local Selectable Instances

Local and anonymous classes that extend `Selectable` get more refined types
than other classes. Here is an example:

```scala
trait Vehicle extends reflect.Selectable:
   val wheels: Int

val i3 = new Vehicle: // i3: Vehicle { val range: Int }
   val wheels = 4
   val range = 240

i3.range
```

The type of `i3` in this example is `Vehicle { val range: Int }`. Hence,
`i3.range` is well-formed. Since the base class `Vehicle` does not define a `range` field or method, we need structural dispatch to access the `range` field of the anonymous class that initializes `id3`. Structural dispatch
is implemented by the base trait `reflect.Selectable` of `Vehicle`, which
defines the necessary `selectDynamic` member.

`Vehicle` could also extend some other subclass of `scala.Selectable` that implements `selectDynamic` and `applyDynamic` differently. But if it does not extend a `Selectable` at all, the code would no longer typecheck:

```scala
trait Vehicle:
   val wheels: Int

val i3 = new Vehicle: // i3: Vehicle
   val wheels = 4
   val range = 240

i3.range // error: range is not a member of `Vehicle`
```

The difference is that the type of an anonymous class that does not extend `Selectable` is just formed from the parent type(s) of the class, without
adding any refinements. Hence, `i3` now has just type `Vehicle` and the selection `i3.range` gives a "member not found" error.

Note that in Scala 2 all local and anonymous classes could produce values with refined types. But
members defined by such refinements could be selected only with the language import
`reflectiveCalls`.

## Relation with `scala.Dynamic`

There are clearly some connections with `scala.Dynamic` here, since
both select members programmatically. But there are also some
differences.

- Fully dynamic selection is not typesafe, but structural selection
  is, as long as the correspondence of the structural type with the
  underlying value is as stated.

- `Dynamic` is just a marker trait, which gives more leeway where and
  how to define reflective access operations. By contrast
  `Selectable` is a trait which declares the access operations.

- Two access operations, `selectDynamic` and `applyDynamic` are shared
  between both approaches. In `Selectable`, `applyDynamic` also may also take
  `java.lang.Class` arguments indicating the method's formal parameter types.
  `Dynamic` comes with `updateDynamic`.
