Scala 3 offers a new way to define programs that can be invoked from the command line:
A `@main` annotation on a method turns this method into an executable program.
Example:

```scala
@main def happyBirthday(age: Int, name: String, others: String*) = {
   val suffix = {
      age % 100 match {
        case 11 | 12 | 13 => "th"
        case _ => {
           age % 10 match {
             case 1 => "st"
             case 2 => "nd"
             case 3 => "rd"
             case _ => "th"
           }
        }
      }
   }
   val bldr = new StringBuilder(s"Happy $age$suffix birthday, $name")
   for other <- others do bldr.append(" and ").append(other)
   bldr.toString
}
```

This would generate a main program `happyBirthday` that could be called like this

```
> scala happyBirthday 23 Lisa Peter
Happy 23rd birthday, Lisa and Peter
```

A `@main` annotated method can be written either at the top-level or in a statically accessible object. The name of the program is in each case the name of the method, without any object prefixes. The `@main` method can have an arbitrary number of parameters.
For each parameter type there must be an instance of the `scala.util.CommandLineParser.FromString` type class
that is used to convert an argument string to the required parameter type.
The parameter list of a main method can end in a repeated parameter that then
takes all remaining arguments given on the command line.

The program implemented from a `@main` method checks that there are enough arguments on
the command line to fill in all parameters, and that argument strings are convertible to
the required types. If a check fails, the program is terminated with an error message.

Examples:

```
> scala happyBirthday 22
Illegal command line after first argument: more arguments expected

> scala happyBirthday sixty Fred
Illegal command line: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "sixty"
```

The Scala compiler generates a program from a `@main` method `f` as follows:

 - It creates a class named `f` in the package where the `@main` method was found
 - The class has a static method `main` with the usual signature. It takes an `Array[String]`
   as argument and returns `Unit`.
 - The generated `main` method calls method `f` with arguments converted using
   methods in the [`scala.util.CommandLineParser`](https://dotty.epfl.ch/api/scala/util/CommandLineParser$.html) object.

For instance, the `happyBirthDay` method above would generate additional code equivalent to the following class:

```scala
final class happyBirthday {
   import scala.util.CommandLineParser as CLP
   <static> def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
      try {
         happyBirthday(
            CLP.parseArgument[Int](args, 0),
            CLP.parseArgument[String](args, 1),
            CLP.parseRemainingArguments[String](args, 2))
      } catch case error: CLP.ParseError => CLP.showError(error)
}
```

**Note**: The `<static>` modifier above expresses that the `main` method is generated
as a static method of class `happyBirthDay`. It is not available for user programs in Scala. Regular "static" members are generated in Scala using objects instead.

`@main` methods are the recommended scheme to generate programs that can be invoked from the command line in Scala 3. They replace the previous scheme to write program as objects with a special `App` parent class. In Scala 2, `happyBirthday` could be written also like this:

```scala
object happyBirthday extends App:
   // needs by-hand parsing of arguments vector
   ...
```

The previous functionality of `App`, which relied on the "magic" [`DelayedInit`](../dropped-features/delayed-init.md) trait, is no longer available. [`App`](https://dotty.epfl.ch/api/scala/App.html) still exists in limited form for now, but it does not support command line arguments and will be deprecated in the future. If programs need to cross-build
between Scala 2 and Scala 3, it is recommended to use an explicit `main` method with an `Array[String]` argument instead.
