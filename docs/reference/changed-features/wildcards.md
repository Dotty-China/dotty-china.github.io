The syntax of wildcard arguments in types has changed from `_` to `?`. Example:
```scala
List[?]
Map[? <: AnyRef, ? >: Null]
```

### Motivation

We would like to use the underscore syntax `_` to stand for an anonymous type parameter, aligning it with its meaning in
value parameter lists. So, just as `f(_)` is a shorthand for the lambda `x => f(x)`, in the future `C[_]` will be a shorthand
for the type lambda `[X] =>> C[X]`. This makes higher-kinded types easier to use. It also removes the wart that, used as a type
parameter, `F[_]` means `F` is a type constructor whereas used as a type, `F[_]` means it is a wildcard (i.e. existential) type.
In the future, `F[_]` will mean the same thing, no matter where it is used.

We pick `?` as a replacement syntax for wildcard types, since it aligns with
[Java's syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/wildcardGuidelines.html).

### Migration Strategy

The migration to the new scheme is complicated, in particular since the [kind projector](https://github.com/typelevel/kind-projector)
compiler plugin still uses the reverse convention, with `?` meaning parameter placeholder instead of wildcard. Fortunately, kind projector has added `*` as an alternative syntax for `?`.

A step-by-step migration is made possible with the following measures:

 1. In Scala 3.0, both `_` and `?` are legal names for wildcards.
 2. In Scala 3.1, `_` is deprecated in favor of `?` as a name for a wildcard. A `-rewrite` option is
    available to rewrite one to the other.
 3. In Scala 3.2, the meaning of `_` changes from wildcard to placeholder for type parameter.
 4. The Scala 3.1 behavior is already available today under the `-source future` setting.

To smooth the transition for codebases that use kind-projector, we adopt the following measures under the command line
option `-Ykind-projector`:

 1. In Scala 3.0, `*` is available as a type parameter placeholder.
 2. In Scala 3.2, `*` is deprecated in favor of `_`. A `-rewrite` option is
    available to rewrite one to the other.
 3. In Scala 3.3, `*` is removed again, and all type parameter placeholders will be expressed with `_`.

These rules make it possible to cross build between Scala 2 using the kind projector plugin and Scala 3.0 - 3.2 using the compiler option `-Ykind-projector`.
