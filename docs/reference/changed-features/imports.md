The syntax of wildcard and renaming imports (and exports) has changed.

## Wildcard Imports

Wildcard imports are now expressed with `*` instead of underscore. Example:
```scala
import scala.annotation.*  // imports everything in the annotation package
```

If you want to import a member named `*` specifically, you can use backticks around it.

```scala
object A:
   def * = ...
   def min = ...

object B:
  import A.`*`   // imports just `*`

object C:
  import A.*     // imports everything in A
```

## Renaming Imports

To rename or exclude an import, we now use `as` instead of `=>`. A single renaming import no longer needs to be enclosed in braces. Examples:

```scala
import A.{min as minimum, `*` as multiply}
import Predef.{augmentString as _, *}     // imports everything except augmentString
import scala.annotation as ann
import java as j
```

### Migration

To support cross-building, Scala 3.0 supports the old import syntax with `_` for wildcards and `=>` for renamings in addition to the new one. The old syntax
will be dropped in a future versions. Automatic rewritings from old to new syntax
are offered under settings `-source 3.1-migration -rewrite`.

### Syntax

```
Import            ::=  ‘import’ ImportExpr {‘,’ ImportExpr}
ImportExpr        ::=  SimpleRef {‘.’ id} ‘.’ ImportSpec
ImportSpec        ::=  NamedSelector
                    |  WildcardSelector
                    | ‘{’ ImportSelectors) ‘}’
NamedSelector     ::=  id [‘as’ (id | ‘_’)]
WildCardSelector  ::=  ‘*' | ‘given’ [InfixType]
ImportSelectors   ::=  NamedSelector [‘,’ ImportSelectors]
                    |  WildCardSelector {‘,’ WildCardSelector}
```
