A union type `A | B` has as values all values of type `A` and also all values of type `B`.


```scala
case class UserName(name: String)
case class Password(hash: Hash)

def help(id: UserName | Password) =
   val user = id match
      case UserName(name) => lookupName(name)
      case Password(hash) => lookupPassword(hash)
   ...
```

Union types are duals of intersection types. `|` is _commutative_:
`A | B` is the same type as `B | A`.

The compiler will assign a union type to an expression only if such a
type is explicitly given. This can be seen in the following [REPL](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/repl/overview.html) transcript:

```scala
scala> val password = Password(123)
val password: Password = Password(123)

scala> val name = UserName("Eve")
val name: UserName = UserName(Eve)

scala> if true then name else password
val res2: Object & Product = UserName(Eve)

scala> val either: Password | UserName = if true then name else password
val either: Password | UserName = UserName(Eve)
```

The type of `res2` is `Object & Product`, which is a supertype of
`UserName` and `Password`, but not the least supertype `Password |
UserName`.  If we want the least supertype, we have to give it
explicitly, as is done for the type of `either`.
