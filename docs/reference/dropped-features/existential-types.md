Existential types using `forSome` (as in
[SLS §3.2.12](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.13/03-types.html#existential-types))
have been dropped. The reasons for dropping them are:

 - Existential types violate a type soundness principle on which DOT
   and Scala 3 are constructed. That principle says that every
   prefix (`p`, respectvely `S`) of a type selection `p.T` or `S#T`
   must either come from a value constructed at runtime or refer to a
   type that is known to have only good bounds.

 - Existential types create many difficult feature interactions
   with other Scala constructs.

 - Existential types largely overlap with path-dependent types,
   so the gain of having them is relatively minor.

Existential types that can be expressed using only wildcards (but not
`forSome`) are still supported, but are treated as refined types.
For instance, the type
```scala
Map[_ <: AnyRef, Int]
```
is treated as the type `Map`, where the first type parameter
is upper-bounded by `AnyRef` and the second type parameter is an alias
of `Int`.

When reading class files compiled with Scala 2, Scala 3 will do a best
effort to approximate existential types with its own types. It will
issue a warning that a precise emulation is not possible.
