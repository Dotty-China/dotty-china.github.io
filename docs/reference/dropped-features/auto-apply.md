Previously an empty argument list `()` was implicitly inserted when
calling a nullary method without arguments. Example:

```scala
def next(): T = ...
next     // is expanded to next()
```

In Scala 3, this idiom is an error.

```scala
next
^
missing arguments for method next
```

In Scala 3, the application syntax has to follow exactly the parameter
syntax. Excluded from this rule are methods that are defined in Java
or that override methods defined in Java. The reason for being more
lenient with such methods is that otherwise everyone would have to
write

```scala
xs.toString().length()
```

instead of

```scala
xs.toString.length
```

The latter is idiomatic Scala because it conforms to the _uniform
access principle_. This principle states that one should be able to
change an object member from a field to a non-side-effecting method
and back without affecting clients that access the
member. Consequently, Scala encourages to define such "property"
methods without a `()` parameter list whereas side-effecting methods
should be defined with it. Methods defined in Java cannot make this
distinction; for them a `()` is always mandatory. So Scala fixes the
problem on the client side, by allowing the parameterless references.
But where Scala allows that freedom for all method references, Scala 3
restricts it to references of external methods that are not defined
themselves in Scala 3.

For reasons of backwards compatibility, Scala 3 for the moment also
auto-inserts `()` for nullary methods that are defined in Scala 2, or
that override a method defined in Scala 2. It turns out that, because
the correspondence between definition and call was not enforced in
Scala so far, there are quite a few method definitions in Scala 2
libraries that use `()` in an inconsistent way. For instance, we
find in `scala.math.Numeric`

```scala
def toInt(): Int
```

whereas `toInt` is written without parameters everywhere
else. Enforcing strict parameter correspondence for references to
such methods would project the inconsistencies to client code, which
is undesirable. So Scala 3 opts for more leniency when type-checking
references to such methods until most core libraries in Scala 2 have
been cleaned up.

Stricter conformance rules also apply to overriding of nullary
methods.  It is no longer allowed to override a parameterless method
by a nullary method or _vice versa_. Instead, both methods must agree
exactly in their parameter lists.

```scala
class A {
   def next(): Int
}

class B extends A {
   def next: Int // overriding error: incompatible type
}
```

Methods overriding Java or Scala 2 methods are again exempted from this
requirement.

### Migrating code

Existing Scala code with inconsistent parameters can still be compiled
in Scala 3 under `-source 3.0-migration`. When paired with the `-rewrite`
option, the code will be automatically rewritten to conform to Scala 3's
stricter checking.
