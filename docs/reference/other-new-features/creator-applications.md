Scala case classes generate apply methods, so that values of case classes can be created using simple
function application, without needing to write `new`.

Scala 3 generalizes this scheme to all concrete classes. Example:

```scala
class StringBuilder(s: String):
   def this() = this("")

StringBuilder("abc")  // old: new StringBuilder("abc")
StringBuilder()       // old: new StringBuilder()
```

This works since a companion object with two `apply` methods
is generated together with the class. The object looks like this:

```scala
object StringBuilder:
   inline def apply(s: String): StringBuilder = new StringBuilder(s)
   inline def apply(): StringBuilder = new StringBuilder()
```

The synthetic object `StringBuilder` and its `apply` methods are called _constructor proxies_.
Constructor proxies are generated even for Java classes and classes coming from Scala 2.
The precise rules are as follows:

 1. A constructor proxy companion object `object C` is created for a concrete class `C`,
    provided the class does not have already a companion, and there is also no other value
    or method named `C` defined or inherited in the scope where `C` is defined.

 2. Constructor proxy `apply` methods are generated for a concrete class provided

    - the class has a companion object (which might have been generated in step 1), and
    - that companion object does not already define a member named `apply`.

    Each generated `apply` method forwards to one constructor of the class. It has the
    same type and value parameters as the constructor.

Constructor proxy companions cannot be used as values by themselves. A proxy companion object must
be selected with `apply` (or be applied to arguments, in which case the `apply` is implicitly
inserted).

Constructor proxies are also not allowed to shadow normal definitions. That is,
if an identifier resolves to a constructor proxy, and the same identifier is also
defined or imported in some other scope, an ambiguity is reported.

### Motivation

Leaving out `new` hides an implementation detail and makes code more pleasant to read. Even though
it requires a new rule, it will likely increase the perceived regularity of the language, since case
classes already provide function call creation syntax (and are often defined for this reason alone).
