Scala 3 has a new "quiet" syntax for control expressions that does not rely on
enclosing the condition in parentheses, and also allows to drop parentheses or braces
around the generators of a `for`-expression. Examples:
```scala
if x < 0 then
   "negative"
else if x == 0 then
   "zero"
else
   "positive"

if x < 0 then -x else x

while x >= 0 do x = f(x)

for x <- xs if x > 0
yield x * x

for
   x <- xs
   y <- ys
do
   println(x + y)

try body
catch case ex: IOException => handle
```

The rules in detail are:

 - The condition of an `if`-expression can be written without enclosing parentheses if it is followed by a `then`.
 - The condition of a `while`-loop can be written without enclosing parentheses if it is followed by a `do`.
 - The enumerators of a `for`-expression can be written without enclosing parentheses or braces if they are followed by a `yield` or `do`.
 - A `do` in a `for`-expression expresses a `for`-loop.
 - A `catch` can be followed by a single case on the same line.
   If there are multiple cases, these have to appear within braces (just like in Scala 2)
   or an indented block.
### Rewrites

The Scala 3 compiler can rewrite source code from old syntax to new syntax and back.
When invoked with options `-rewrite -new-syntax` it will rewrite from old to new syntax, dropping parentheses and braces in conditions and enumerators. When invoked with options `-rewrite -old-syntax` it will rewrite in the reverse direction, inserting parentheses and braces as needed.
