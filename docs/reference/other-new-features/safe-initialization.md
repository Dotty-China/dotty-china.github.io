Scala 3 实现了实现性质的安全初始化检查，可以通过编译器选项 `-Ysafe-init` 启用。

## A Quick Glance

To get a feel of how it works, we first show several examples below.

### Parent-Child Interaction

Given the following code snippet:

``` scala
abstract class AbstractFile:
   def name: String
   val extension: String = name.substring(4)

class RemoteFile(url: String) extends AbstractFile:
   val localFile: String = s"${url.##}.tmp"  // error: usage of `localFile` before it's initialized
   def name: String = localFile
```

The checker will report:

``` scala
-- Warning: tests/init/neg/AbstractFile.scala:7:4 ------------------------------
7 |	val localFile: String = s"${url.##}.tmp"  // error: usage of `localFile` before it's initialized
  |	    ^
  |    Access non-initialized field value localFile. Calling trace:
  |     -> val extension: String = name.substring(4)	[ AbstractFile.scala:3 ]
  |      -> def name: String = localFile            	[ AbstractFile.scala:8 ]
```

### Inner-Outer Interaction

Given the code below:

``` scala
object Trees:
   class ValDef { counter += 1 }
   class EmptyValDef extends ValDef
   val theEmptyValDef = new EmptyValDef
   private var counter = 0  // error
```

The checker will report:

``` scala
-- Warning: tests/init/neg/trees.scala:5:14 ------------------------------------
5 |  private var counter = 0  // error
  |              ^
  |             Access non-initialized field variable counter. Calling trace:
  |              -> val theEmptyValDef = new EmptyValDef    [ trees.scala:4 ]
  |               -> class EmptyValDef extends ValDef       [ trees.scala:3 ]
  |                -> class ValDef { counter += 1 }	     [ trees.scala:2 ]
```

### Functions

Given the code below:

``` scala
abstract class Parent:
   val f: () => String = () => this.message
   def message: String

class Child extends Parent:
   val a = f()
   val b = "hello"           // error
   def message: String = b
```

The checker reports:

``` scala
-- Warning: tests/init/neg/features-high-order.scala:7:6 -----------------------
7 |  val b = "hello"           // error
  |      ^
  |Access non-initialized field value b. Calling trace:
  | -> val a = f()                              	[ features-high-order.scala:6 ]
  |   -> val f: () => String = () => this.message	[ features-high-order.scala:2 ]
  |    -> def message: String = b	                [ features-high-order.scala:8 ]
```
## Design Goals

We establish the following design goals:

- __Sound__: checking always terminates, and is sound for common and reasonable usage (over-approximation)
- __Expressive__: support common and reasonable initialization patterns
- __Friendly__: simple rules, minimal syntactic overhead, informative error messages
- __Modular__: modular checking, no analysis beyond project boundary
- __Fast__: instant feedback
- __Simple__: no changes to core type system, explainable by a simple theory

By _reasonable usage_, we include the following use cases (but not restricted to them):

- Access fields on `this` and outer `this` during initialization
- Call methods on `this` and outer `this` during initialization
- Instantiate inner class and call methods on such instances during initialization
- Capture fields in functions

## Principles

To achieve the goals, we uphold three fundamental principles:
_stackability_, _monotonicity_ and _scopability_.

Stackability means that all fields of a class are initialized at the end of the
class body. Scala enforces this property in syntax by demanding that all fields
are initialized at the end of the primary constructor, except for the language
feature below:

``` scala
var x: T = _
```

Control effects such as exceptions may break this property, as the
following example shows:

``` scala
class MyException(val b: B) extends Exception("")
class A:
   val b = try { new B } catch { case myEx: MyException => myEx.b }
   println(b.a)

class B:
   throw new MyException(this)
   val a: Int = 1
```

In the code above, the control effect teleport the uninitialized value
wrapped in an exception. In the implementation, we avoid the problem
by ensuring that the values that are thrown must be transitively initialized.

Monotonicity means that the initialization status of an object should
not go backward: initialized fields continue to be initialized, a
field points to an initialized object may not later point to an
object under initialization. As an example, the following code will be rejected:

``` scala
trait Reporter:
   def report(msg: String): Unit

class FileReporter(ctx: Context) extends Reporter:
   ctx.typer.reporter = this                // ctx now reaches an uninitialized object
   val file: File = new File("report.txt")
   def report(msg: String) = file.write(msg)
```

In the code above, suppose `ctx` points to a transitively initialized
object. Now the assignment at line 3 makes `this`, which is not fully
initialized, reachable from `ctx`. This makes field usage dangerous,
as it may indirectly reach uninitialized fields.

Monotonicity is based on a well-known technique called _heap monotonic
typestate_ to ensure soundness in the presence of aliasing
[1]. Roughly speaking, it means initialization state should not go backwards.

Scopability means that there are no side channels to access to partially constructed objects. Control effects like coroutines, delimited
control, resumable exceptions may break the property, as they can transport a
value upper in the stack (not in scope) to be reachable from the current scope.
Static fields can also serve as a teleport thus breaks this property.  In the
implementation, we need to enforce that teleported values are transitively
initialized.

The principles enable _local reasoning_ of initialization, which means:

> An initialized environment can only produce initialized values.

For example, if the arguments to an `new`-expression are transitively
initialized, so is the result. If the receiver and arguments in a method call
are transitively initialized, so is the result.

## Rules

With the established principles and design goals, following rules are imposed:

1. In an assignment `o.x = e`, the expression `e` may only point to transitively initialized objects.

   This is how monotonicity is enforced in the system. Note that in an
   initialization `val f: T = e`, the expression `e` may point to an object
   under initialization. This requires a distinction between mutation and
   initialization in order to enforce different rules. Scala
   has different syntax for them, it thus is not an issue.

2. References to objects under initialization may not be passed as arguments to method calls or constructors.

   Escape of `this` in the constructor is commonly regarded as an
   anti-pattern, and it's rarely used in practice. This rule is simple
   for the programmer to reason about initialization and it simplifies
   implementation. The theory supports safe escape of `this` with the help of
   annotations, we delay the extension until there is a strong need.

3. Local definitions may only refer to transitively initialized objects.

   It means that in a local definition `val x: T = e`, the expression `e` may
   only evaluate to transitively initialized objects. The same goes for local
   lazy variables and methods. This rule is again motivated for simplicity in
   reasoning about initialization: programmers may safely assume that all local
   definitions only point to transitively initialized objects.

## Modularity (considered)

Currently, the analysis works across project boundaries based on TASTy.
The following is a proposal to make the checking more modular.
The feedback from the community is welcome.

For modularity, we need to forbid subtle initialization interaction beyond
project boundaries. For example, the following code passes the check when the
two classes are defined in the same project:

```Scala
class Base:
   private val map: mutable.Map[Int, String] = mutable.Map.empty
   def enter(k: Int, v: String) = map(k) = v

class Child extends Base:
   enter(1, "one")
   enter(2, "two")
```

However, when the class `Base` and `Child` are defined in two different
projects, the check can emit a warning for the calls to `enter` in the class
`Child`. This restricts subtle initialization within project boundaries,
and avoids accidental violation of contracts across library versions.

We can impose the following rules to enforce modularity:

1. A class or trait that may be extended in another project should not
   call _virtual_ methods on `this` in its template/mixin evaluation,
   directly or indirectly.

2. The method call `o.m(args)` is forbidden if `o` is not transitively
   initialized and the target of `m` is defined in an external project.

3. The expression `new p.C(args)` is forbidden, if `p` is not transitively
   initialized and `C` is defined in an external project.

## Theory

The theory is based on type-and-effect systems [2, 3]. We introduce two concepts,
_effects_ and _potentials_:

```
π = this | Warm(C, π) | π.f | π.m | π.super[D] | Cold | Fun(Π, Φ) | π.outer[C]
ϕ = π↑ | π.f! | π.m!
```

Potentials (π) represent values that are possibly under initialization.

- `this`: current object
- `Warm(C, π)`: an object of type `C` where all its fields are assigned, and the potential for `this` of its enclosing class is `π`.
- `π.f`: the potential of the field `f` in the potential `π`
- `π.m`: the potential of the field `f` in the potential `π`
- `π.super[D]`: essentially the object π, used for virtual method resolution
- `Cold`: an object with unknown initialization status
- `Fun(Π, Φ)`: a function, when called produce effects Φ and return potentials Π.
- `π.outer[C]`: the potential of `this` for the enclosing class of `C` when `C.this` is `π`.

Effects are triggered from potentials:

- `π↑`: promote the object pointed to by the potential `π` to fully-initialized
- `π.f!`: access field `f` on the potential `π`
- `π.m!`: call the method `m` on the potential `π`

To ensure that the checking always terminate and for better
performance, we restrict the length of potentials to be finite (by
default 2). If the potential is too long, the checker stops
tracking it by checking that the potential is actually transitively
initialized.

For an expression `e`, it may be summarized by the pair `(Π, Φ)`,
which means evaluation of `e` may produce the effects Φ and return the
potentials Π. Each field and method is associated with such a pair.
We call such a pair _summary_. The expansion of proxy potentials and effects,
such as `π.f`, `π.m` and `π.m!`, will take advantage of the summaries.
Depending on the potential `π` for `this`, the summaries need to be rebased (`asSeenFrom`) before usage.

The checking treats the templates of concrete classes as entry points.
It maintains the set of initialized fields as initialization
progresses, and check that only initialized fields are accessed during
the initialization and there is no leaking of values under initialization.
Virtual method calls on `this` is not a problem,
as they can always be resolved statically.

For a more detailed introduction of the theory, please refer to the paper _a type-and-effect system for safe initialization_ [3].

## Back Doors

Occasionally you may want to suppress warnings reported by the
checker.  You can either write `e: @unchecked` to tell the checker to
skip checking for the expression `e`, or you may use the old trick:
mark some fields as lazy.

## Caveats

- The system cannot provide safety guarantee when extending Java or Scala 2 classes.
- Safe initialization of global objects is only partially checked.
