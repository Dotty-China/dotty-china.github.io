Scala 3 allows traits to have parameters, just like classes have parameters.

```scala
trait Greeting(val name: String):
   def msg = s"How are you, $name"

class C extends Greeting("Bob"):
   println(msg)
```

Arguments to a trait are evaluated immediately before the trait is initialized.

One potential issue with trait parameters is how to prevent
ambiguities. For instance, you might try to extend `Greeting` twice,
with different parameters.

```scala
class D extends C, Greeting("Bill") // error: parameter passed twice
```

Should this print "Bob" or "Bill"? In fact this program is illegal,
because it violates the second rule of the following for trait parameters:

 1. If a class `C` extends a parameterized trait `T`, and its superclass does not, `C` _must_ pass arguments to `T`.

 2. If a class `C` extends a parameterized trait `T`, and its superclass does as well, `C` _must not_  pass arguments to `T`.

 3. Traits must never pass arguments to parent traits.

Here's a trait extending the parameterized trait `Greeting`.

```scala
trait FormalGreeting extends Greeting:
   override def msg = s"How do you do, $name"
```
As is required, no arguments are passed to `Greeting`. However, this poses an issue
when defining a class that extends `FormalGreeting`:

```scala
class E extends FormalGreeting // error: missing arguments for `Greeting`.
```

The correct way to write `E` is to extend both `Greeting` and
`FormalGreeting` (in either order):

```scala
class E extends Greeting("Bob"), FormalGreeting
```

### Traits With Context Parameters

This "explicit extension required" rule is relaxed if the missing trait contains only
[context parameters](../contextual/using-clauses). In that case the trait reference is
implicitly inserted as an additional parent with inferred arguments. For instance,
here's a variant of greetings where the addressee is a context parameter of type
`ImpliedName`:

```scala
case class ImpliedName(name: String):
  override def toString = name

trait ImpliedGreeting(using val iname: ImpliedName):
   def msg = s"How are you, $iname"

trait ImpliedFormalGreeting extends ImpliedGreeting:
   override def msg = s"How do you do, $iname"

class F(using iname: ImpliedName) extends ImpliedFormalGreeting
```

The definition of `F` in the last line is implicitly expanded to
```scala
class F(using iname: ImpliedName) extends
   Object,
   ImpliedGreeting(using iname),
   ImpliedFormalGreeting(using iname)
```
Note the inserted reference to the super trait `ImpliedGreeting`, which was not mentioned explicitly.
