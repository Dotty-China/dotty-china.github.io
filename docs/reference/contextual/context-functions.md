_Context functions_ are functions with (only) context parameters.
Their types are _context function types_. Here is an example of a context function type:

```scala
type Executable[T] = ExecutionContext ?=> T
```
Context functions are written using `?=>` as the "arrow" sign.
They are applied to synthesized arguments, in
the same way methods with context parameters are applied. For instance:
```scala
  given ec: ExecutionContext = ...

  def f(x: Int): ExecutionContext ?=> Int = ...

  // could be written as follows with the type alias from above
  // def f(x: Int): Executable[Int] = ...

  f(2)(using ec)   // explicit argument
  f(2)             // argument is inferred
```
Conversely, if the expected type of an expression `E` is a context function type
`(T_1, ..., T_n) ?=> U` and `E` is not already an
context function literal, `E` is converted to a context function literal by rewriting it to
```scala
  (x_1: T1, ..., x_n: Tn) ?=> E
```
where the names `x_1`, ..., `x_n` are arbitrary. This expansion is performed
before the expression `E` is typechecked, which means that `x_1`, ..., `x_n`
are available as givens in `E`.

Like their types, context function literals are written using `?=>` as the arrow between parameters and results. They differ from normal function literals in that their types are context function types.

For example, continuing with the previous definitions,
```scala
  def g(arg: Executable[Int]) = ...

  g(22)      // is expanded to g((ev: ExecutionContext) ?=> 22)

  g(f(2))    // is expanded to g((ev: ExecutionContext) ?=> f(2)(using ev))

  g((ctx: ExecutionContext) ?=> f(3))  // is expanded to g((ctx: ExecutionContext) ?=> f(3)(using ctx))
  g((ctx: ExecutionContext) ?=> f(3)(using ctx)) // is left as it is
```

### Example: Builder Pattern

Context function types have considerable expressive power. For
instance, here is how they can support the "builder pattern", where
the aim is to construct tables like this:
```scala
  table {
     row {
        cell("top left")
        cell("top right")
     }
     row {
        cell("bottom left")
        cell("bottom right")
     }
  }
```
The idea is to define classes for `Table` and `Row` that allow the
addition of elements via `add`:
```scala
  class Table:
     val rows = new ArrayBuffer[Row]
     def add(r: Row): Unit = rows += r
     override def toString = rows.mkString("Table(", ", ", ")")

  class Row:
     val cells = new ArrayBuffer[Cell]
     def add(c: Cell): Unit = cells += c
     override def toString = cells.mkString("Row(", ", ", ")")

  case class Cell(elem: String)
```
Then, the `table`, `row` and `cell` constructor methods can be defined
with context function types as parameters to avoid the plumbing boilerplate
that would otherwise be necessary.
```scala
  def table(init: Table ?=> Unit) =
     given t: Table = Table()
     init
     t

  def row(init: Row ?=> Unit)(using t: Table) =
     given r: Row = Row()
     init
     t.add(r)

  def cell(str: String)(using r: Row) =
     r.add(new Cell(str))
```
With that setup, the table construction code above compiles and expands to:
```scala
  table { ($t: Table) ?=>

    row { ($r: Row) ?=>
      cell("top left")(using $r)
      cell("top right")(using $r)
    }(using $t)

    row { ($r: Row) ?=>
      cell("bottom left")(using $r)
      cell("bottom right")(using $r)
    }(using $t)
  }
```
### Example: Postconditions

As a larger example, here is a way to define constructs for checking arbitrary postconditions using an extension method `ensuring` so that the checked result can be referred to simply by `result`. The example combines opaque type aliases, context function types, and extension methods to provide a zero-overhead abstraction.

```scala
object PostConditions:
   opaque type WrappedResult[T] = T

   def result[T](using r: WrappedResult[T]): T = r

   extension [T](x: T)
      def ensuring(condition: WrappedResult[T] ?=> Boolean): T =
         assert(condition(using x))
         x
end PostConditions
import PostConditions.{ensuring, result}

val s = List(1, 2, 3).sum.ensuring(result == 6)
```
**Explanations**: We use a context function type `WrappedResult[T] ?=> Boolean`
as the type of the condition of `ensuring`. An argument to `ensuring` such as
`(result == 6)` will therefore have a given of type `WrappedResult[T]` in
scope to pass along to the `result` method. `WrappedResult` is a fresh type, to make sure
that we do not get unwanted givens in scope (this is good practice in all cases
where context parameters are involved). Since `WrappedResult` is an opaque type alias, its
values need not be boxed, and since `ensuring` is added as an extension method, its argument
does not need boxing either. Hence, the implementation of `ensuring` is as about as efficient
as the best possible code one could write by hand:

```scala
val s =
   val result = List(1, 2, 3).sum
   assert(result == 6)
   result
```
